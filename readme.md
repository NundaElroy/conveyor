Conveyor CI is a(the first) Software Framework for building CI/CD Platforms. It provides a set of tools(programs) and SDKs that abstract the complexities of building CI/CD Platforms by implementing common features that CI/CD platforms require.

Key features that Conveyor CI provides include:

- **Built-In Observability**: Conveyor provides seamless integration of **Metrics**, **Tracing**, and **Logging**, so you can monitor, trace, and debug workflows at every stage without external setups
- **Declarative API for CI/CD Workflows**: Conveyor CI and its API adopt a decelarative and this helps yor design pipelines that are highly customizable and extensible
- **Realtime Event System**: Conveyor’s powerful event-driven architecture lets drivers publish and respond to events in realtime, enabling fast, responsive execution of tasks across your system.
- **Effortless Horizontal Scaling**: Conveyor’s runtime enables automatic horizontal scaling of drivers across distributed systems, optimized for cloud-native deployments all with zero extra code.
- **Realtime Log Management**: Conveyor CI Drivers include a built-in Logger that supports realtime log streaming and storage.
