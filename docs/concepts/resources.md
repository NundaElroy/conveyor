# Resources

A Resource is the core object in a Conveyor CI Platform that defines the pipeline configuration. It tells the CI Driver what to do, when to do it and how to do it. A comparison would be the Workflow file in the GitHub Actions.

## Resource Definitions

By default, Conveyor CI does not come with any Resource in its API. You have to install them into Conveyor CI. To install a Resource, you must define a Resource Definetion. A Resource defenition is method of defining the Schema of a Resource. It determines how the Resouce will be defined, what properties it will have and also the validation schema for the resource.

Resource definitions are created by following the [Open API Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.3.md). They can be defined either in Yaml or JSON syntax and saved into the Conveyor CI API. Resource Definitions have only two mandatory requirementsa and these are:

An example of a Resource definition in yaml.

```yml
name: application
version: 0.0.1
schema:
  openAPIV3Schema:
    type: object
    properties:
      spec:
        type: object
        properties:
          pipeline:
            type: object
            properties:
              name:
                type: string
              stages:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
              distributed:
                type: boolean
              runners:
                type: array
                items:
                  type: string
            required:
              - name
              - stages
              - distributed
              - runners
```

This above Resouce Definition defines a Resource named `application` and it can be used like this below.

```yml
pipeline:
  name: build-and-deploy
    stages:
      - test
      - build
      - deploy
    distributed: true
    runners:
      - cloud-native
```

A Resouce Definition have three mandatory fields.

- `name`: This defines the name of the Resource.
- `version`: This defines the version of the Resouce Definition
- `schema`: This contains the Open API Schema used to validate the resource
